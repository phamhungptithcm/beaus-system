# Microservices System Design for Beaus System

This repository contains the design and documentation for a microservices-based system that I am building as part of my BigTech interview preparation. The system will be composed of various microservices, each responsible for a specific domain, and the repository will track the progress of tasks required for the systemâ€™s design and implementation.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document the functional and non-functional requirements for each service.
- Design and plan how different services will communicate, handle errors, scale, and secure sensitive data.
- Create detailed design documentation that includes API contracts, database schemas, sequence diagrams, and other system design artifacts.
- Ensure that the system is ready for implementation in a structured, modular, and maintainable way.

## Microservices in Scope

This repository will track the design of the following microservices:
1. **User Service** - Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Product Service** - Manages product listings, details, and inventory.
3. **Catalog Service** - Manages product categories and search functionality.
4. **Cart Service** - Maintains shopping cart data for customers.
5. **Order Service** - Handles order creation, tracking, and history.
6. **Payment Service** - Processes payments securely with integration to third-party gateways.
7. **Notification Service** - Sends system notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications.
8. **Review and Feedback Service** - Manages customer reviews and feedback for products.
9. **Seller Management Service** - Handles seller registration and store management.
10. **Admin Service** - Provides admin tools for user management, system moderation, and analytics.
11. **Recommendation Engine** - Offers personalized product recommendations.
12. **Analytics Service** - Collects and analyzes platform metrics and reports.
13. **Logistics Service** - Tracks shipping and delivery statuses.
14. **Search Service** - Implements advanced search capabilities.
15. **Marketing Service** - Manages promotions and SEO optimization.
16. **Audit and Logging Service** - Logs system events for auditing and debugging.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
- **/requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements for each service.
- **/system-design**: High-level architecture, technologies, inter-service communication methods, and scalability considerations.
- **/detailed-design**: Service interface designs, database schemas, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, and class diagrams.
- **/tasks**: A list of tasks to be completed in preparation for the interview, including milestones and progress tracking.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your work.
2. **Create issues** to track specific tasks or features.
3. **Submit pull requests** once your changes are complete.
4. **Review and discuss** design decisions in the issues section.

## Goals

- Ensure the system is designed with scalability, performance, and security in mind.
- Create a solid foundation for building microservices that can be implemented using Java (Spring Boot), Kafka, Redis, Postgres, etc.
- Document error handling strategies, resilience patterns, and data consistency approaches.
